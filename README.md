## finger math algorithm

First lecture for Nov 26 cohort...  solving finger math

## Algorithm
This is how it goes:

- Pick two numbers between 6 and 10
- Map numbers to each hand following these order:
  - 6 -> thumb
  - 7 -> index
  - 8 -> middle
  - 9 -> ringer
  - 10 -> pinky
- Group all fingers that are up to the "mapped" finger
- Repeat for the second number on the other hand
- Join the mapped fingers, count them and multiply by 10
- Take the leftover fingers from each hand and multiply left by right
- Add up the mapped x 10 value with the leftover multiplication
- Done... this should be the result
